Hi, I am Tawsif! I am an analytics professional currently working for Aimia, supporting the Amex and CIBC Aeroplan portfolios. Before Aimia, I was with PriceMetrix doing analytics for some of the major wealth managements firms in North America.

I was born and raised in Bangladesh, and after completing my Bachelors degree in Engineering, I moved to Canada to study Applied Mathematics at University of Waterloo. I am passionate about mathematics and the application of it to deliver rigorous in-depth analytics to drive business decisions. I am inquisitive in nature and enjoy research, analysis and solving problems that require critical thinking. Over the coming years, my goal is to develop an understanding of different industries while adding value with my skills and build a cross-industry analytics experienced profile. 

Always keen on meeting people to have a chat, so please feel free to contact me!
