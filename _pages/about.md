Hi, I am Tawsif! I am an analytics professional currently working for Aimia, supporting the Amex and CIBC Aeroplan portfolios. Before Aimia, I worked with PriceMetrix, a firm focused on wealth-management analytics. I was born in Bangladesh, and after my completing my Bachelor in Electrical Engineering, I moved to Canada in 2013 for my Master of Mathematics program at University of Waterloo.
